In this project, I worked with a database called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. 
The database has 11 related tables. I used SQL lite studio to run various queries on the database.

#1. How many distinct playlists are there in chinook database.?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PlaylistId) AS PlaylistCount 
FROM Playlists;

#2. What is the average duration of tracks per genre?

SELECT genres.Name, AVG(Milliseconds AS AverageDuration
FROM genres
JOIN tracks ON genres.Genreld=tracks.Genreld
GROUP BY genres.Name;

#3. How many distinct composers are there in the database?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Composer) AS ComposerCount
FROM tracks
WHERE Composer IS NOT NULL;

#4. How many different artists are represented in the database?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ArtistId) AS ArtistCount
FROM Artists;

#5. What is the average number of tracks per album?

SELECT AVG(TrackCount) AS AverageTracksPerAlbum
FROM (
SELECT AlbumId, COUNT(*) AS TrackCount
FROM Tracks
GROUP BY AlbumId
) AS TrackCounts;

#6. What are the different media types available in the database?

SELECT DISTINCT MediaTypeId, Name
FROM Media_Types;

#7. How many customers have made a purchase?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerId) AS CustomerCount
FROM Invoices;

#8. What is the average invoice total?

SELECT AVG(Total) AS Average_Invoice_Total
FROM Invoices;

#9. Which customer made the highest purchase in terms of total amount?

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, MAX(Total) AS HighestPurchaseAmount
FROM Invoices
JOIN Customers ON Invoices.CustomerId = Customers.CustomerId;

#10. What is the total sales revenue for each genre?

SELECT Genres.Name, SUM(Invoices.Total) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Genres
JOIN Tracks ON Genres.GenreId = Tracks.GenreId
JOIN Invoice_items ON Tracks.TrackId = Invoice_items.TrackId
JOIN Invoices ON Invoice_items.InvoiceId = Invoices.InvoiceId
GROUP BY Genres.Name;
